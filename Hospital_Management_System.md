# Hospital/Healthcare Management System

**Subject:** Database Fundamentals
**Complexity:** Advanced | **Time Estimate:** 10-12 hours

---

## Project Objectives
By the end of this project, learners will be able to:
* Design and normalize a relational database schema that models a hospital management domain effectively.
* Develop conceptual, logical, and physical database models to ensure scalability and maintainability.
* Implement CRUD operations and complex queries using SQL and JDBC.
* Apply indexing, hashing, searching, and sorting algorithms to optimize database access.
* Integrate database operations into a JavaFX application interface for practical interaction.
* Compare relational and NoSQL designs for unstructured data storage such as patient notes or medical logs.
* Measure and document performance improvement through optimization and indexing.

## Project Description
This stage of the Hospital Management System focuses on building the data layer and persistence logic that will power the full application in later modules.

Students will design a relational database for a hospital management system, implement the schema using SQL, and integrate it with a JavaFX application that performs essential operations including patient registration, appointment scheduling, medical records management, and reporting.

The system must reflect real-world hospital logic (patients, doctors, departments, appointments, prescriptions, medical inventory) while incorporating data structure and algorithm concepts (caching, indexing, sorting, searching) to enhance performance.

## Epics and User Stories

### Epic 1: Database Design and Modeling
**User Story 1.1:** As a database designer, I want to create conceptual, logical, and physical database models so that the data structure is clear and efficient.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Conceptual ERD includes all major entities and relationships.
    * Logical model defines attributes, primary keys, and foreign keys.
    * Physical model includes SQL data types, constraints, and normalization (up to 3NF).

**User Story 1.2:** As a database administrator, I want to define indexes and relationships so that queries run efficiently, and data integrity is maintained.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Appropriate primary and foreign keys are applied.
    * Indexes are defined on frequently searched or joined columns.
    * Referential integrity and constraints are enforced.

### Epic 2: Data Access and CRUD Operations
**User Story 2.1:** As an administrator, I want to add, update, and delete patient and doctor data from the JavaFX interface so that I can manage hospital records.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * All CRUD operations are functional via the JavaFX interface.
    * Input validation and feedback messages are implemented.
    * Database constraints prevent duplicate or invalid entries.

**User Story 2.2:** As a receptionist, I want to view patients and their medical history from the application so that I can assist with registration and appointment scheduling.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Patient listings are displayed dynamically from the database.
    * Pagination or search filters improve usability.
    * Data is retrieved using parameterized queries through JDBC.

### Epic 3: Searching, Sorting, and Optimization
**User Story 3.1:** As a receptionist, I want to search for patients quickly by name or ID so that I can locate records efficiently.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Patient search is case-insensitive and responsive.
    * Search optimization is achieved through indexing and/or hashing.
    * Measurable improvement in query response time is documented.

**User Story 3.2:** As a developer, I want to implement in-memory caching and sorting so that frequently accessed or sorted data is retrieved faster.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Caching layer implemented using in-memory structures (e.g., maps or lists).
    * Sorting and searching algorithms integrated and documented.
    * Cache invalidation logic ensures data consistency after updates.

### Epic 4: Performance and Query Optimization
**User Story 4.1:** As an analyst, I want to generate performance reports comparing pre- and post-optimization so that I can measure system efficiency.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * Query execution times recorded before and after optimization.
    * Indexes and caching demonstrate measurable performance gains.
    * Report clearly communicates methodology and findings.

**User Story 4.2:** As a developer, I want to explore storing patient notes or medical logs in a NoSQL format so that unstructured data can be efficiently handled.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * NoSQL data model created for patient notes or medical logs.
    * Justification provided for why NoSQL is suitable for the use case.
    * Optional implementation comparison included in performance report.

### Epic 5: Reporting and Documentation
**User Story 5.1:** As a project contributor, I want to produce documentation and reports so that the project can be reviewed, reused, or extended.
* **Acceptance Criteria:**
    * ERD diagrams and database documentation included.
    * SQL scripts and sample data provided.
    * A README file describes setup, dependencies, and execution steps.

## Technical Requirements

### Database
* Use MySQL or PostgreSQL for the relational database implementation.
* Database schema normalized to Third Normal Form (3NF).
* Include at least the following entity groups: Patients, Doctors, Departments, Appointments, Prescriptions, PrescriptionItems, PatientFeedback, MedicalInventory.
* Define indexes on high-frequency columns (e.g., patient name, doctor ID, appointment date, department ID).
* Implement foreign keys to maintain referential integrity.

### Application Layer (JavaFX + JDBC)
* Use JavaFX for user interaction: patient registration, appointment scheduling, CRUD operations, and reporting.
* Database access implemented using JDBC with parameterized queries to prevent SQL injection.
* Logical separation of concerns (Controller - Service - DAO).
* In-memory structures (e.g., Map, List) used to cache and sort results.
* Include an admin panel for patient/doctor management and performance monitoring.

### Data Structures & Algorithms Integration
* **Hashing/Caching:** Use in-memory data structures to speed up lookups.
* **Sorting & Searching:** Apply appropriate algorithms for ordering and filtering data.
* **Indexing Concept:** Explain how in-memory structures mirror database index logic. Performance Measurement: Demonstrate efficiency improvements from optimization efforts.
